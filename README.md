# 24XX in Typst

This is [24XX SRD](https://jasontocci.itch.io/24xx) by Jason Tocci recreated using the [Typst](https://typst.app/) typesetting engine. You can use this as a template to create your own game if you are like me who feel more comfortable composing a document with code than using desktop publishing software.

Fonts used:

- Barlow
- IBM Plex Sans (for `₡`)
- Noto Sans CJK SC (for `➡` and `▶`)

These fonts are all available in the Typst web app. You can also download them from Google Fonts (*Noto Sans CJK SC* should be renamed to *Noto Sans SC* if you use this way).
